## How to contribute to BorgLLM

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in BorgLLM**, and instead contact the maintainer directly at borgllm [at] omarkama.li.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/omarkamali/borgllm/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/omarkamali/borgllm/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with your changes.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution, or the new feature and its benefits. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* All contributions should adhere to the project's coding style and conventions.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code or want to discuss a new feature?**

* Please open a new discussion or issue on GitHub to ask questions or propose new features.
